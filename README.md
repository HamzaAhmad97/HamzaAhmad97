Hi, Iâ€™m DaMhAzMaH, Ra^ or Hamza Ahmad, whichever suits you. A mechanical engineer, a somehow good artist and writer, a physics enthusiast (quantum mechanics and relativity - not astronomy ;)). I am not trying to make the world a better place, but instead I am trying to **unlock my mind**, whatever this is supposed to mean.
