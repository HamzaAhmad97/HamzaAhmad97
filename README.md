I am Hamza Ahmad, I am 23 y/o, majored in mechanical engineering, and currently learning full stack web development. My interests include robotics, machine learning, physics and web development. I am also kind of a good painter, and sometimes writer. I am not trying to make the world a better place, but instead I am trying to **unlock my mind**, whatever this is supposed to mean.
